Analyze Cricket Commentary Using NLP
====================================
An application written in python to analyze cricket Commentary using Natural Language Processing. This application is part of my final year project.

Setting up:
------------
Clone the repository ```git@bitbucket.org:cricketstatistics/project.git```

Run ```python main.py```

Instructions:
------------
The code as of now only extracts the runs scored, number of balls completed and whether a wicket was taken or not.
The data used for analysis is stored in the directory ```/assets/training_dataset/crickbuzz_data.txt``` and the output is stored in ```/assets/out/out.txt```
